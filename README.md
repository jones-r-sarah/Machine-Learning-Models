During my time in my Masters Degree program I have made many models so I decided to keep them here

There are my Quick Models which are just small tasks and things but there are also bigger 
assignments and projects which are in the other folder.

Feel free to take a look!
All of it was coded in Python but since it was done in Andocanda they exported in Juypter Notebooks.

NN - Neural Network Model (MLP Classifier)
SVM_SJ - Support Vector Machine (SVM) Model
P3_G8 - Project 3
P1_M - Project 1
